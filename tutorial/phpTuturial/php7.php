                        In PHP, you can add comments to your code to provide explanations or make notes. Comments are
                        not executed as part of the program and are ignored by the PHP interpreter. They are useful for
                        documenting your code or temporarily disabling certain sections of code. PHP supports two types
                        of comments:
                    </h4>

                    

                <h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>Single-line comments:</span>Single-line comments start with // and continue until the
                            end of the line.
                            <span>
                                // This is a single-line comment
                                $name = "John"; // Assigning a value to the variable

                            </span>
                            Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */, allowing you to comment multiple lines.

                            <span>
                                /*
                                This is a multi-line comment.
                                It can span across multiple lines.
                                */
                                $age = 25; // Variable declaration

                            </span>
                        </li>

                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Comments are primarily used for code documentation, clarifying the purpose of certain code sections,
                    or temporarily disabling code for testing or debugging purposes. By adding comments to your code,
                    you can make it more understandable and maintainable for yourself and others who read the code.

                    It's good practice to include comments in your code, especially for complex logic or when working in
                    a team environment, as it promotes code readability and helps in understanding the code's
                    functionality.
