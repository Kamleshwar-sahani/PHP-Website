                        code around objects, which are instances of classes. PHP is a versatile programming language
                        that supports object-oriented programming. Here's an example of how you can create and use

                    <h4>
                        Reusability is a key principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows code
                        components to be used in multiple contexts or projects without requiring duplication
                        or modification. It promotes efficiency, modularity, and maintainability by enabling
                        the reuse of existing code. In PHP, you can achieve reusability through the
                        following techniques
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span>Classes and Objects: </span> Create classes that encapsulate related
                                data and functionality. Objects instantiated from these classes can be
                                reused in different parts of your application or across multiple projects.
                            </li>
                            <li><span>Inheritance:</span>Use inheritance to create a new class (child class)
                                based on an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits the
                                properties and methods of the parent class and can also add its own unique
                                properties and methods. This allows you to reuse and extend the
                                functionality of the parent class.</li>
                            <li><span>Interfaces: </span>Define interfaces that specify a set of methods
                                that classes implementing the interface must implement. By programming to
                                interfaces rather than concrete classes, you can achieve polymorphism and
                                interchangeability. This allows you to reuse code across different classes
                                that implement the same interface.</li>
                            <li><span>Traits: </span>Traits are reusable code units that can be included in
                                multiple classes. You can define common functionality in traits and then
                                include them in different classes using the use keyword. This allows you to
                                reuse code across classes without the limitations of single inheritance.
                            </li>
                            <li><span>Libraries and Packages:</span>Utilize external libraries and packages
                                that provide pre-built, reusable components for specific tasks. PHP has a
                                rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that you can leverage to save
                                development time and effort.</li>
