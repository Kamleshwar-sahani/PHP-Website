                    <h4>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used server-side scripting language primarily designed
                        for web development. It is particularly well-suited for creating dynamic web pages and building
                        web applications. PHP code is embedded within HTML, allowing developers to mix PHP and HTML
                        seamlessly.</h4>
                    <h4>
                        PHP has been widely adopted for web development and powers numerous popular websites and web
                        applications, including Facebook, WordPress, and Wikipedia. Its ease of use, extensive features,
                        and large developer community make it a popular choice for building dynamic and interactive web
                        applications.

                                Server-side scripting: PHP is executed on the server, generating HTML output that is
                                sent to the client's web browser. This approach allows for dynamic content generation,
                                database interactions, and other server-side processing.

                                code.</li>
                            <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) support: PHP supports object-oriented programming
                                paradigms, allowing developers to write modular, reusable, and organized code. This
                                approach enhances code maintainability and scalability.</li>
                            <li>Rich functionality: PHP offers a wide range of built-in functions and libraries for
                                various tasks, including file handling, database access, form validation, encryption,
                                and more. These built-in features simplify common web development tasks and reduce the
                                need for external dependencies.</li>
                            <li>Easy deployment: PHP applications can be deployed on various web servers with minimal
                                configuration. PHP is supported by most hosting providers, making it straightforward to
                                deploy web applications to production environments.</li>
