                    <h4>In PHP, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are containers that hold values of different data types, such as strings, numbers, or objects. Variables in PHP are dynamically typed, meaning they can hold different types of values throughout the execution of a program.</h4>
                    <h4     >Here are the key points to understand about variables in PHP:</h4>
                    <h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Variable Declaration: In PHP, variables are declared using the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name. For example: $name, $age, $count.

                            </li>

                            <li>Variable Assignment: To assign a value to a variable, you use the assignment operator (=). For example: $name = "John Doe";, $age = 25;</li>


                            <li>Data Types: PHP variables can store various data types, including strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, objects, null, resources, and callables. The data type of a variable is determined dynamically based on the assigned value.</li>



                            <li>Variable Naming Rules: Variable names in PHP must start with a letter or underscore (_) and can be followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case-sensitive, meaning $name and $Name are considered as two different </li>


                            <li>Variable Scope: The scope of a variable defines its accessibility within different parts of the PHP script. PHP supports several types of variable scopes, including global scope, function scope, and class scope. The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed and modified.

                            </li>

                            <li>Variable Interpolation: PHP supports variable interpolation within double-quoted strings. This means that variables can be directly embedded within double-quoted strings without concatenation. For example: echo "My name is $name.";.</li>

                            <li>Variable Manipulation: PHP provides various operators and functions for manipulating variables. You can perform mathematical operations, concatenate strings, modify variable values, and more using these operators and functions.</li>

                            <li>Variable Output: You can display the value of a variable using the echo or print statements. For example: echo $name;, print($age);.</li>
                            <li>
                                Variable Scope Resolution: PHP allows access to variables from outer scopes within functions or classes using the global keyword or the $GLOBALS superglobal array. This allows you to access variables declared outside of the current scope.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </h4>
                    <h4>Variables are fundamental building blocks in PHP programming. They provide a means to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, enabling dynamic behavior and interactivity within PHP scripts and applications.</h4>
